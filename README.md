Accessible Tiles
================

Interactive tiles are a common design pattern found on the web. 
With care, we can make them fancy & fun while still working with screen readers. 
Here are two approaches I've tested with Safari & VoiceOver.


Files included:

index.html
_ui/js/main.js
_ui/css/_main.scss
_ui/css/compiled.scss

To compile SCSS:

$ gem install sass 
$ sass --watch _ui/css/_main.scss:_ui/css/compiled.css
